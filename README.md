# Flower-Arrangement-Service-using-MultimodalRAG
This project implements a multimodal RAG system for designing creative flower arrangements. Flower images are stored in ChromaDB with OpenCLIP embeddings, enabling natural language queries like “What flowers would look elegant for a wedding bouquet?” The model then generates personalized bouquet suggestions grounded in retrieved visuals.
